@7000 = ~I won't waste the chance that you and Eloran have given me.~
@7001 = ~So, someone else has come to argue for my death?~
@7002 = ~Persuade me to let you live.~
@7003 = ~Why did you turn to banditry?~
@7004 = ~Why wait until now to feel remorse?~
@7005 = ~Why Lathander? Why not flee to the Ilmateri?~
@7006 = ~We're done here for now.~
@7007 = ~After what I’ve seen? I just… watched. If I had done anything, I would’ve joined ‘em and gotten killed too, but… I don’t know.~
@7008 = ~If you can’t beat ‘em, join ‘em. I used to run caravans up and down the Sword Coast, but we were raided too many times. Went bankrupt and had to make ends meet somehow. Can’t say it felt right, stealing from others and doing to them what got me in this mess, but hey, gotta eat, and it’s not like we were killing anybody. In the early days, at least. ~
@7009 = ~It’s not ‘until now’. I knew I had to get out when I saw… that day. But I couldn’t just leave. I know what that ogre is capable of. I needed something big, something that’d draw everyone’s attention so I could sneak out. You attacking the camp was the only opportunity that I had.~
@7010 = ~I don’t believe in Ilmater. Not anymore. Some things are too big to forgive. Lathander… he’s about new beginnings, isn’t he? I can’t be forgiven, but maybe I can start over. Become someone new.~
@7011 = ~(Ovlin doesn’t say anything. Just nods.)~
