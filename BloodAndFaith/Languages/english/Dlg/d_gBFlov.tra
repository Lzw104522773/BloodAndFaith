@12000 = ~Have you come to suffer?~
@12001 = ~I have this invisibility ring from Eloran for you. They’ll help you hide from the paladins and the Fist.~
@12002 = ~Shouldn’t you be trying to convince me to spare you?~
@12003 = ~No, but you’re about to.~
@12004 = ~Eloran? I know she’s not one of the Ilmateri here. Who is she and why does she think to give me this ring?~
@12005 = ~She’s a fool, is what she is. Now, are you going to take the ring or not?~
@12006 = ~She’s a Lathanderite and has taken pity on your plight.~
@12007 = ~She’s a Lathanderite, though to be honest, I’m not sure why she’d do this either.~
@12008 = ~Then you are a fool for listening to her. But I'll take the ring. I doubt you'll see me again.~
@12009 = ~I don’t need anyone’s pity, and certainly not from–nevermind. I'll take the ring. I doubt you'll see me again.~
@12010 = ~	Then I don’t know why you’d listen to her, but I’ll take the ring. I doubt you'll see me again.~
@12011 = ~You expected a Loviatan - I’m playing my part in this, as you surely will. Go on, do what heroes are supposed to do.~
@12012 = ~I just wanted to talk to you. I heard you’d repented. How does a Loviatan end up making amends with Ilmater?~
@12013 = ~I'll just kill you then.~
@12014 = ~I was a slave in Dambrath and gained Loviatar’s favor through my ability to suffer without flinching. It was a useful skill for a slave. Eventually, I was able to flee. Along the way, I met a group of monks. They…. They treated me like a person. They were Ilmateri, and treated me well, despite my faith in Loviatar. Life is suffering, but I didn’t really realize that there were gods out there to alleviate suffering rather than inflict it and teach you to shoulder it. I feel guilty for my service to Loviatar, but is not guilt a form of psychological pain? Am I still serving a god I no longer worship? I don’t know. And I want to speak with the Ilmateri here, perhaps find answers. Are you satisfied?~
@12015 = ~I have this invisibility ring from Eloran for you. It'll help you hide from the paladins and the Fist.~
@12016 = ~No. I'm going to kill you.~
@12017 = ~As I expected. I don’t know why I thought - never mind that. I'll die here, but not before I make you bleed.~
