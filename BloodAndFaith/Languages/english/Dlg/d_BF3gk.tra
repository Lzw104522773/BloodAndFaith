@6000 = ~Oh, thank the gods you’re here. I have no idea what could be happening here. Please just… take a look around Nashkel and see if you can find any clues.~
@6001 = ~I’ll take a look around.~
@6002 = ~Thank you. And please hurry!~
@6003 = ~I found this missing person. He was upset at receiving a Helmite funeral and wants an Ibrandulite funeral instead, and so he rose from the dead. He'll go back to being dead if you give him a new funeral.~
@6004 = ~He… wants us to redo the funeral? That’s it? I was worried that he wanted vengeance or that there was a grave robber! I can redo the funeral. Go tell him to come back here.~
@6005 = ~Tell the zombie to come see me for a new funeral.~
@6006 = ~Thank you for your help.~
