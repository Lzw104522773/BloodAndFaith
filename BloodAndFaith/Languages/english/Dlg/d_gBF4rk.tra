@9000 = ~You’re here to get rid of us, are you? Well, I’m not moving out, unless you can find me something better!~
@9001 = ~Why are you here?~
@9002 = ~What do you want?~
@9003 = ~[Persuade] There’s a warren just to the north that a Malarite used to live in. You could move there.~
@9004 = ~[Persuade] There’s a warren just to the north that a Malarite used to live in. It'd be smarter to live there, away from pesky adventurers.~
@9005 = ~ [Intimidate] I’m going to kill you.~
@9006 = ~Hm. I'll come back later.~
@9007 = ~We live here. It’s a nice house.~
@9008 = ~We just want to live in peace together. Happy, healthy, well fed.~
@9009 = ~You do that. We'll all still be here, considering we live here now.~
@9010 = ~You do that. We'll all still be here, considering we live here now. ~
@9011 = ~Hm… A place of our own to move into? No one trying to chase us out all the time or squash us? Hmm… We will try it.~
@9012 = ~Wait, wait, wait! You seem strong. We don't want to fight you. We'll leave.~
@9013 = ~Away from civilization? No thanks. Not much to do out in the wilderness. Less free food, too.~
@9014 = ~Pfah! You are outnumbered! My rats, attack!~
