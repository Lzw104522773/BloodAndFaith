@6500 = ~Hmph! You want me back in the ground, huh? Well, I won’t go back! Not unless it’s on my terms! An Ibrandulite funeral’s the only way I’m getting back in the ground!~
@6501 = ~What are your terms?~
@6502 = ~I could just kill you, you know. Then you’ll be dead again.~
@6503 = ~I’ll let the gravekeeper know that.~
@6504 = ~They gave me the wrong funeral! They gave me a funeral for a Helmite! I ain’t no Helmite! I’m a miner, through and through, and Helm ain’t a god for miners–Ibrandul is! I’m not staying in the ground unless I get a proper funeral, worthy of a miner!~
@6505 = ~Pfah, I’m already dead! If you kill me, I’ll just get back up again, unless you give me a proper Ibrandulite funeral afterwards!~
@6506 = ~You do that. I’ll be here.~
@6507 = ~Go tell them to give me a proper Ibrandulite funeral!~
@6508 = ~He'll redo the funeral? Alright, let’s do this then.~
