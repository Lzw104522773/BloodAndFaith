@8001 = ~Your husband is haunting your former house and keeps going on about coins.~
@8002 = ~He’s what?! Oh no. He had a coin collection that he loved. I wanted to keep it to remember him by, so I didn’t bury it with him. But if he wants it and having it would help him rest, then… Here. Take it. Please help him. I–I think I need to be alone now.~
