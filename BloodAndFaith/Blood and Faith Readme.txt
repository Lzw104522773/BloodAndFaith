Mod Name: Blood and Faith

Premise: Too often, criminals get away with their misdeeds for one reason or another. A certain Lathanderite cleric wants to change that, but she needs your help. This is a tale of blood and faith, a tale of damnation… or of redemption.

Features:
- 14 quests! 
- Emphasis on roleplay
- Evil Charnames can optionally turn neutral, depending on how you complete the questline!
- Good Charnames can optionally turn neutral, depending on how you complete the questline!
- Neutral Charnames can optionally turn good or evil, depending on how you complete the questline!
- Suitable for any class/alignment! There’s justification for evil PCs and the Lathanderite to work together
- Two endings!
- 8,000+ words of dialogue!
- Additional lore-friendly Lore, featuring gods like Malar and Ibrandul!
- A new cleric/thief of Lathander, who just might become a possible companion in BG2 (I'm working on it, but it'll be a WHILE)

//KNOWN ISSUES
/////////////////////
- The Zhent Agent that you kill initially has the green circle/is under player control
- The Renegade Zhent in the Cloakwood sometimes turns hostile if you have Party AI on.
- Sometimes you don't get XP for killing stuff. This is INTENTIONAL, as you get XP for completing the quests instead.

If you find anything else, ping me on Discord or post it to the G3 forums.
